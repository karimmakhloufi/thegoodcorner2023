## Getting Started

This is a opiniated NextJS boilerplate with following configurations:

- Server Side Rendering is disabled
- The api folder was deleted
- Use of CSS modules
- The app router is not used

To start the boilerplate, run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

Happy Hacking !
